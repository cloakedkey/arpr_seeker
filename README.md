script written in python that helps you do things with arithmetic progression like finding a term or a sum of terms.

I wrote this back in school to make it easier for me to do boring math homework and I decided that it would be a good idea to publish this project on github.

## Setup
To get it working you need to have python3 pip and install these modules:
```
pip3 install pyfiglet
pip3 install termcolor

Linux/macOS
```
```
pip install pyfiglet
pip install termcolor

Windows
```
